I'll be editing series of articles focused dedicated on key point of my current professional life,
and the first series will be dedicated to the Information Technology Infrastructure Library, more commonly known as ITIL.

# What is ITIL?

ITIL is a library of best practices for quality IT Service Management (ITSM) last updated in 2011 to what is now called ITIL 2001 or ITILv3.
All of this is only trading a question for another, isn't it? What is ITSM then?
**ITSM** defines all the different responsibilities in the processes that lead to the creation of value to the customer, in that case: A product or service.

There is no doubts that ITIL is widely recognized but, no matter how much it is spread and accepted we have to be clear: **ITIL is not a standard**,
but merely a framework to help your service management activities. As such, it proposes its suggestive view on what could be beneficial in your Service life cycle.
ITIL is often confused as a standard because of the **ISO 20000* which is based on the ITIL framework but targets organizations, so keep in mind:
You may be ITIL certified, your company may be ISO 20000 certified.
