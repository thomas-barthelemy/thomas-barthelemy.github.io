I recently had to create an AWS EC2 AMI for Kaltura (see kaltura.org) using Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL7),
and when trying to install the  Kaltura package I ran into missing dependencies.
A bit of reading made me realize that not all repositories where accessible by default and some
tweaking was necessary to get it to work.
Here are a few cool things I used:

# List and enable available repositories

Not all repositories are enabled by default, you can list them using the yum-utils package installed
by default on the EC2 instances of RHEL7 using:
    
    yum repolist all
    
You can then chose, for example, to enable the optional repository:

    yum-config-manager --enable rhui-REGION-rhel-server-optional
    

# EPEL Repository
I installed the Fedora Project, the latest address being:
    
    http://download-i2.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm
    
So you can install this simply using:

    rpm -Uvh http://download-i2.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/7/x86_64/e/epel-release-7-5.noarch.rpm
    yum update
